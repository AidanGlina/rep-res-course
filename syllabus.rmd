# Syllabus  {#syllabus}

Here is the outline of the topics, readings, and assignments for our
course.  Readings should be done _before_ the session that they are listed
for.  For example, if it says Reading X is for Tuesday Oct 14, then 
you should have done that reading prior to coming to the class at 
3:30 on Oct 14.  

Most assignments will be "turned in" on GitHub, and will be due at the
time stated.  Don't let this get your blood pressure up.  This course is
not for credit and you will not be graded.  But you will learn a lot more
and you will be far more likely to benefit from using R and git and GitHub if
you do the assignments.
