# Assignment 0  {#assignment-0}

## Due October 7, 2014
These are the things that you should do before the first meeting of the course to prepare your
laptop (which you must bring to the course) with the necessary software.  Please don't plan
to download this software in the conference room!  The wireless network there connects to a 
pretty small pipe, so we can't have everyone downloading things at the same time.

### Overview
I want everyone to:

1. Install R
1. Install Rstudio
1. Install Git

Below I have explicit instructions for Macs and PC's.


### Instructions on a Mac
#### Install R
I would like everyone to be running R version 3.1.0 (2014-04-10) or later.  If you have
that already, great. If not, download the latest version from http://cran.us.r-project.org/   Click on
the `Download R for (Mac) OS X` link on that page and choose the `R-3.1.1-snowleopard.pkg` link if you
don't have the Mavericks operating system and `R-3.1.1-mavericks.pkg` if you.  Install it.  


#### Install Rstudio

### Instructions on a PC
I don't have a PC, so I am doing this on a fresh instance of a MS 2012 Server on Amazon's elastic compute
cluster.  

#### Install R

1. From http://cran.us.r-project.org/ click on `Download R for Windows`.
1. On the next page click on the `base` link, and on the next page the `Download R 3.1.1 for Windows` link.
1. Run the installer.  Click `Next` on everthing to accept the defaults.

Once that is done you want to go back one page in your browser and then

1. click on the `Rtools` link.  (We will end up using these to build our own packages, and also to build other people's packages.)
1. Click on the `Rtools31.exe` link. 
1. Run the Rtools installer and choose the default settings.  (__Note__ if you already have Cygwin you need to do something different than the default.  If you already have Cygwin, though, you don't need any handholding...)


#### Install RStudio

1. Go to http://www.rstudio.com/
1. Click on the big `Download RStudio` button.
1. Click on the `Desktop` version.
1  On the next page click `Download Rstudio Desktop`
1. Under `Installers for All Platforms` get the appropriate one for yourself (i.e. Windows) and run the installer.
1. You can choose all the defaults.

You can now use RStudio.  However, we ought to go get git as well

#### Install git

1. Go to http://msysgit.github.io/
1. Under where it says "we bring the awesome Git SCM to Windows" Hit the `Download` button. 
1. Run the installer.  The default choices appear to be best. Go ahead and use them unless you know what you are doing.  In particular, I think you should stick with using Git Bash as the shell.

That should install fine.  When you are done.  Re-launch RStudio and see if it has detected git on the system.

1. In the RStudio menu select `Tools` -> `Global Options` and on the bottom select Git/SVN.
1. If it says (Not Found) under `Git executable` then browse for it.  On my PC it was installed into 
`Program Files (x86)/Git/bin/git.exe`.  Go ahead and choose that.
  - after that you might have to hit Apply and then OK rather than just OK.  You might also need to restart RStudio.
