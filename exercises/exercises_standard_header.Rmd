## How To Do This Homework
To do this homework, you have to 

1. pull down the master branch of
the rep-res-course repository to get this assignment:
    * _If you don't already have a clone of the rep-res-course repository_, clone the rep-res-course repository:
        1. Choose File->New Project
        1. When asked, choose “Create Project from Version Control”
        1. Then when asked choose "Git"
        1. For repository URL use this: https://github.com/eriqande/rep-res-course.git
        1. Let the project directory be named `rep-res-course`. Put it somewhere. You might consider having a dedicated directory for all your work in this course.
        1. Hit “Create Project”.
    * _If you already have a clone of the rep-res-course repository_
        1. Open up the RStudio project `rep-res-course.Rproj`
        1. If you are not on branch `master` in that project (check the upper
        right corner of the "Git" pane---if it does not say "master" in small letters you are not 
        on the master branch), then __commit any changes on whatever branch you are on__ (If you don't commit
        changes on the branch you are on, then they will get carried back
        to the master branch and could cause problems pulling.), and then checkout
        the master branch (this can be done by clicking on the branch name in the upper right of the Git pane
        and choosing `master` (__not__ `origin/master`)).    
        1. Once on the `master` branch click the "pull button at the top of the Git pane.
1. Immediately checkout a new branch named `r rr_branch_name`:
    1. go to the “Tools” menu item in RStudio and within it choose "Shell...". This will pop up a command prompt window (Terminal window on a mac. GitBash Window or a Command Prompt Window on PC).
    1. In the command window, type this command:
        ```{r, echo=FALSE, comment=NA}
        cat(paste("git checkout -b", rr_branch_name))
        ```
        and hit RETURN.
1. open the file `r rr_hw_file_name` and add your answers (see below)
1. Commit that file, and push your branch up to your fork of the rep-res-course
repository.


In my opinion, one of the most useful binary operators
is `%in%`. However it is seldom discussed in detail in books about R
from the previous decade.  It's nice to see that Hadley has it front and 
center in the vocabulary section of his Advanced R book. 

It can be used to test if the elements of a vector A also occur (or do not occur)
in a vector B.  For example
```{r in-for-example, gather_answers = TRUE}
A <- c("a", "g", "Z", "y", "c")
B <- letters[1:5]
A %in% B

## and here I want to see if anything is happening:
rr_homework_name
rr_question_number
```


Here is a simple question.  Here is the setup:
```{r in-ex-1-set-up}
# imagine x look like this:
x <- c(1, 4, 18, 9)
# and y like this:
set.seed(10)
y <- sample(1:100, size = 30)
```

Now, here is the first question:
```{r in-ex-1-first, rr.question=TRUE}
x
y

# this should have gotten incremented:
rr_question_number

submit_answer({
  # put your answer on the line between here
  x %in% y
  y %in% x
  y * x
  `+`(x,y)
  # and here
})
#print(chunker)
```


## Another part {#another-part}
```{r super-easy, rr.question=TRUE}
x <- 1:10
```


```{r Boingus, rr.question=TRUE}
submit_answer({
  y<-1:10; z<- y^2; z;
  list(What = y, Never = "squawk", Again = z)
})
```


```{r Bogulated, rr.question=TRUE}
submit_answer({
  y<-1:10; z<- y^2; z;
  list(What = y, Never = "squawk", Again = z)
  xx <- 1:10; yy <- xx + rnorm(10, 0, .04)
  unclass(lm(yy~xx))
})
```




```{r}
ls(envir = rrhw_env)

# now make a list of it:
reslist <- as.list(rrhw_env)

library(plyr)
zz <- ldply(.data = reslist, .fun = answer_list_to_data_frame)
save(zz, file="/tmp/zz.rda")
```
