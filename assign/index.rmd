# Course Assignments {#course-assign-overview}

## Week 0 {#ass-week-0}
These are the things that you should do before the first meeting of the course to prepare your
laptop (which you must bring to the course) with the necessary software.  Please don't plan
to download this software in the conference room!  The wireless network there connects to a 
pretty small pipe, so we can't have everyone downloading things at the same time.
