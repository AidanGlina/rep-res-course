# Assignment 2 {#assignment-2}

## Do This Before the Thursday class of Week 1

There is nothing to turn in for this assignment.  But I want everyone to do the following:

1. Open up the `project1` project we made in class, or just open up RStudio.
2. In the RStudio menu, choose, `File -> New File -> R Markdown ...`
3. Then save that file.  Change its name from `Untitled.rmd` to `first.rmd`
4. Find and click the `knit` button near the top left of the screen.

That should give you a nice web document with a plot, etc.

Now, in RStudio, go to the Help menu and choose `Markdown Quick Reference` and read it.
