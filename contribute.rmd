# How to Contribute
The content of this website is Eric C. Anderson's first attempt at teaching
a course in which 98% of the content is written using Rmarkdown. Currently
all the sources are built on my local machine using Jekyll (because GitHub does
not support custom Jekyll plugins) and then I push the results (in the _site directory) up to the
gh-pages branch of my rep-res-course repository on GitHub.

If you have recommended edits, the best way to get them to me is to:

1. Have a GitHub account.
2. Click on the "Edit this page" button.

Doing so will give you a fork of the rep-res-course repository, and you can
edit the raw Rmarkdown source that produced the page and send me a pull request.
Understand that any contributions you make that are pulled into the project
will enter the public domain.

I welcome any recommendations from simple typo-fixes to suggestions on how my R code 
can be improved and suggestions
on how this material could be taught more effectively.   I would particularly appreciate
it if you were to send me any fun "homework exercises" that would be beneficial for students
learning this material.

If you have any questions, feel free to raise them in the pull request, or
send me [an email](mailto:eric.anderson@noaa.gov).
