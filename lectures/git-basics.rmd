# Git Basics {#git-basics}

Goals for Today:

* Explain what git is (and how it is different than GitHub)
* Introduce the sha-1 hash (for fun!)
* Get familiar with RStudio's very convenient interface to git
    + staging files
    + unstaging file
    + viewing differences between staged and unstaged files
    + committing files
    + viewing the commit history

## An overview of Version Control Systems (VCS) {#vcs}

* Git is a type of VCS
* At its crudest, a VCS is a system that provides a way of saving
and restoring earlier versions of a file.

### A typical VCS for a non-computer programmer

* Start writing `my_manuscript.doc`.
* At some point worry that MS Word is going to eat your file, so,
    + Make a "backup" called `my_manuscript_A.doc`
* Then, before overhauling the discussion, save the current file as
`my_manuscript_B.doc`. 
* Email it to your coauthors and then have a series of files with other
extensions such as the initials of their names when they edit them and send
them back.
* Etc.
* Disadvantages:
    + Hard to find a good record of what is in each version.  (Wait! I liked the introduction
    I wrote three weeks ago...where is that now?)
    + A terrible system if you have multiple files that are dependent on one another
    (for example, figures in your document, or scripts and data sets if you have a 
    programming project.)
    + If you decide that you want to merge the changes you made to the discussion in version `_C`
    with the edits on the introduction in version `_K`, it is hard.

### Other popular VCS systems

* rcs, cvs, subversion, etc.
* These all had a "Centralized" model:
    + You set up a repository on a server that has the full version history, 
    + then each person working on it gets a copy of the current version, and nothing more.
    + They can submit changes back to the central repository which tries to deal with conflicting
    submissions.
    + You need to be online to do most operations.
* I used a few of these, and missed them for a few weeks when I switched to Git, but 
then never looked back and couldn't imagine using them again.


### The Git model --- Distributed Version Control

* Git stores "snapshots" of your collection of files in a repository
* For our work, the "collection of files" will be "the stuff in your RStudio project"
    + Another reason it is nice to keep everything you need for a project together in a "project directory"
* When you clone or repository, __you__ get the whole version history 
* When someone else clones that repository, __they also__ get the whole version history.
* Git has well-developed features for merging changes made in different repositories
    + But, for today, we will talk mostly of a single user interacting with git.

## Git versus GitHub

* They are not the same thing!
* Git is software that you can run on your own machine for doing version on a repository.
    + It can be _entirely_ local.  i.e. only on your hard drive and nowhere else.
    + This is super-useful for any project, because solid version control is great to have.
* GitHub is a website, with tools powered by Git (and many that they brewed up themselves) that
makes it very, very easy to share git repositories with people all over the place.

### Is everything on GitHub public?

* No!  Many companies use GitHub to host their proprietary code
    + They just have to pay for that...
* By default, you can put anything on GitHub for free as long as it is
under a fairly free-use (open source type) license and it is available to anyone
* If you want a private repository, as an academic affiliate you just have to ask
and GitHub will give you up to 5 private repos for free.
* Also, they have a sweet ["student pack"](https://github.com/blog/1900-the-best-developer-tools-now-free-for-students)


### What should I keep under version control?

* General rule: don't keep derived products.
    + i.e. If you have and Rmd file that creates an html file, there isn't much need to put the html 
    file under version control with git, because you can just regenerate it by Knitting the Rmd file.
    
### How can I make git ignore certain files?

* The `.gitignore` file!
* File names (and patterns) in the `.gitignore` file are ignored _recursively_ (down into subdirectories), 
by default.
* Files won't be ignored if they are already in the repository.
* Example:
