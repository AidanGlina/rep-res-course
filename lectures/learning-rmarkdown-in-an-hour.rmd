# Learning R Markdown in one Hour {#rmarkdown-in-an-hour}

In this session our goal is to:

1. Learn and use many of the features of Rmarkdown
1. See how to intermix R code with text
1. Collaboratively write a document to illustrate how Rmarkdown works

The crazy thing is that, even though Rmarkdown provides an incredibly powerful tool for
authoring reproducible research documents, you really can learn most of the fundamentals
in about an hour.


## Rmarkdown Setup {#rmarkdown-setup}

If you completed [Assignment 2](#assignment-2) you will ready to go.

1. Open up your project1 project from Tuesday in Rstudio
1. Choose `File -> New File -> R markdown...` and then select HTML document and hit OK
1. Save the file as "auto-recipe.Rmd"
