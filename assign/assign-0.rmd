# Assignment 0  {#assignment-0}

## Due October 7, 2014
These are the things that you should do before the first meeting of the course to prepare your
laptop (which you must bring to the course) with the necessary software.  Please don't plan
to download this software in the conference room!  The wireless network there connects to a 
pretty small pipe, so we can't have everyone downloading things at the same time.

### Overview
I want everyone to:

1. Install R
1. Install Rstudio
1. Install Git

Below I have explicit instructions for Macs and PC's.


### Instructions on a Mac
#### Install R
I would like everyone to be running R version 3.1.0 (2014-04-10) or later.  If you have
that already, great. If not, download the latest version from http://cran.us.r-project.org/   Click on
the `Download R for (Mac) OS X` link on that page and choose the `R-3.1.1-snowleopard.pkg` link if you
don't have the Mavericks operating system and `R-3.1.1-mavericks.pkg` if you.  Install it.  


#### Install Rstudio
